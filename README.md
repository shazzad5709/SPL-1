A Class Diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram 
that depicts the structure of a system by displaying the system’s classes, their attributes, 
operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. The class diagram is the 
foundation of object-oriented modeling. It is used for both general conceptual modeling of the 
application’s structure and detailed modeling, which involves translating the models into 
programming code.
This project translates the models into programming code i.e., create a basic structure of the 
project. It is useful for projects that are very large, as by using this tool the entire structure 
can be instantly created, and the programmer can then just focus on the logical 
implementation part. Moreover, since this program can generate source code in two different 
languages, situation-based structure generation can also come in handy.
