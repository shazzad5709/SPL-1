                                                                PseudoCoder
  
PseodoCoder is an algorithm interpreter program that runs on a terminal. When given an algorithm as input, it parses it, generates C++ code, and saves it in a text file.


The goal of this program is to make the learning process of beginning programming students easier. They can concentrate on solving a problem and writing an algorithm for that problem, and then use this program to generate code, allowing them to concentrate on the problem solving rather than the coding syntax. As they improve at understanding and solving problems, they will be able to learn more complex coding.
