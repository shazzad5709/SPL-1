                                                PseudoCoder

PseodoCoder is a terminal-based algorithm interpreter program. Upon taking an algorithm as input, it parses the given algorithm and generates a C++ code and stores it in a text file.

The objective of this program is to ease the learning process of beginner programming students. They can mainly focus on solving a problem and write an algorithm for said problem, and they can use this program to generate a code, which will result in more focus on the problem solving part instead of focusing more on the coding syntax. As they start to get better on understanding and solving the problem first, they can then start learning more complex coding.
